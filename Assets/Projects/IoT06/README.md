## Developing an IoT-Based Smart Grid Architecture for Efficient Energy Distribution

**Problem statement:**

Traditional power grids lack real-time optimization, leading to over-reliance on fossil fuels even when renewable energy is available.Current grids struggle to integrate renewable sources efficiently, resulting in underutilization and increased carbon emissions.There is no autonomous system to prioritize renewable energy over fossil fuels based on real-time demand and supply.Grids lack real-time monitoring tools, delaying fault detection and reducing overall efficiency.Reactive maintenance and operational inefficiencies increase costs and lead to longer downtimes during outages.

**Proposed Solution:**
- **Smart Energy Management:** Automatically balances power generation by prioritizing renewable and nuclear energy, activating fossil fuels only when necessary.

- **Autonomous Decision-Making:** Optimize energy production based on real-time and forecasted demand.

- **IoT Dashboard:** A centralized platform for monitoring energy supply, demand, and system health in real-time.

     
**Hardware Requirements:**
1. ESP32 board
2. INA219 Module
3. Breadboard & Jumper wires
4. LEDs & 570-ohm Resistors for LEDs


**Software Requirements:**
1. Arduino IDE
2. Thingspeak Cloud


**Sustainable Development Goals:**

- **SDG 7:** Affordable and Clean Energy
It focuses directly on improving energy systems to make energy more accessible, affordable, and sustainable, which is exactly what an IoT-based smart grid aims to achieve by optimizing energy use and promoting clean energy.

- **SDG 11 :** Sustainable Cities and Communities
Connects directly to how IoT can transform cities into more energy-efficient and sustainable environments by improving electricity distribution, reducing waste, and supporting cleaner urban living.
