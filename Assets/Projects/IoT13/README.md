### Problem Statement
The supply chain management of milk faces significant challenges in ensuring transparency, traceability, efficiency, and quality control. Traditional systems are often fragmented, rely heavily on manual processes, and lack real-time monitoring and verification mechanisms. These shortcomings result in inefficiencies, higher costs, and compromised milk quality, ultimately affecting consumer trust and satisfaction.
#### Key challenges:
- Lack of Transparency and Traceability
- Quality Degradation
- Inefficiencies in Processes
- Fraud and Adulteration
- Limited Consumer Trust.
### Solution
Integrating Blockchain and IoT technologies offers a potential solution to these challenges. Blockchain can provide an immutable, transparent, and decentralized record of transactions, ensuring trust and traceability. IoT devices, such as temperature and humidity sensors, can provide real-time data on the storage and transportation conditions of milk, enabling proactive quality management. By leveraging these technologies, stakeholders can build a more efficient, trustworthy, and consumer-focused milk supply chain.
### Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 Board : 
- DHT11 Temperature/Humidity :
- GPS Module (NEO-6M) : 
- PIR Motion sensor(HC-SR501) :
### Software Requirements
TBD
### Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
- This project satisfies the following SDGs:
| **Goal** | **Function** |
|:--------:|:------------:|
| SDG 2    | Reduce milk waste by monitoring storage conditions and ensuring optimal transportation logistics.|
| SDG 12   | Ensure a safe and sustainable supply of milk by reducing wastage and spoilage through real-time monitoring.|
| SDG 17   | Collaboration among farmers, producers, distributors, and consumers through a transparent Blockchain-enabled ecosystem|
