## IoT#24

### Hardware Requirements

1. **Arduino Uno**: Serves as the central microcontroller for data processing and control.
2. **Node-MCU ESP8266**: Provides Wi-Fi connectivity for data transmission to cloud platforms.
3. **16x2 LCD**: Displays real-time air quality readings in parts per million (PPM).
4. **MQ135 Gas Sensor**: Measures indoor air quality by detecting gases like ammonia, nitrogen oxides, and benzene.
5. **MQ7 LPG Gas Sensor**: Detects carbon monoxide (CO) levels, ensuring safety against this toxic gas.
6. **Buzzer**: Emits audible alerts when pollutant levels exceed predefined thresholds.
7. **LEDs**: Visually indicate air quality status through color-coded signals.

### Software Requirements

1. **Arduino IDE**: Used for programming the Arduino Uno and Node-MCU ESP8266 boards, facilitating sensor integration and data handling.
2. **ThingSpeak**: A cloud-based platform for monitoring and analyzing air quality data in real-time.
