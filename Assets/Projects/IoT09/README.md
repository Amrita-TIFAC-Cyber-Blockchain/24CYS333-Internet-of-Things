Problem Statement
-------------------
Urban transportation faces significant challenges, including congestion,
 environmental concerns, and inefficient bike sharing systems. Traditional
 bike-sharing setups often lack smart features like seamless payment, real-time
 tracking, and maintenance alerts, limiting their appeal and usability. In addition,
 users often face problems such as unclear vehicle availability, lack of range
 estimation, and difficulty ensuring bike security.<br>
 This project aims to design and implement a prototype Smart Bike Sharing System
 that integrates Internet of Things (IoT) technology to address these challenges. The
 system focuses on two key functionalities: payment-based unlocking and dynamic
 range display.<br>
 A GPS module will enable real-time tracking, allowing users and administrators to
 monitor the bikeâ€™s location for safety and efficient management.

Hardware Requirements
-------------------------

| Component                  | Functionality                                                                                    |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| ESP 32 Micro controller    | Core control unit to handle logic.                                                               |
| Servo Motor                | Simulates the physical lock/unlock mechanism.                                                    |
| GPS Module (NEO-6M)        | Tracks the bike's location in real time and enables location based features.                     |
| OLED/LED Display Panel     | Shows status messages (e.g., "Unlocked")                                                         |
| Buzzer                     | Audio feedback for lock/unlock status                                                            |
| Power Supply (Battery)     | Ensures portability and uninterrupted power supply to the system.                                |
| LED indicators             | Offers a simple and clear visual cue for the lock's status.                                      |
| Breadboard and Jump Wires  |  Allows prototyping by connecting components without soldering.                                  |
