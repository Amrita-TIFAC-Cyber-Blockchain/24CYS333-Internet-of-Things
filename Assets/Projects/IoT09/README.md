**Problem Statement:** <br>
Urban transportation faces significant challenges, including congestion,
 environmental concerns, and inefficient bike sharing systems. Traditional
 bike-sharing setups often lack smart features like seamless payment, real-time
 tracking, and maintenance alerts, limiting their appeal and usability. In addition,
 users often face problems such as unclear vehicle availability, lack of range
 estimation, and difficulty ensuring bike security.<br>
 This project aims to design and implement a prototype Smart Bike Sharing System
 that integrates Internet of Things (IoT) technology to address these challenges. The
 system focuses on two key functionalities: payment-based unlocking and dynamic
 range display.<br>
 A GPS module will enable real-time tracking, allowing users and administrators to
 monitor the bikeâ€™s location for safety and efficient management.

**Hardware Requirements:** <br>
- Neo 6m (GPS module) <br>
- ESP 32 Micro controller <br>
- OLED/LED Display Panel <br>
- Power Supply (Battery) <br>
- LED Indicators <br>
- Buzzer <br>
- Breadboard <br>
- Jump Wires <br>
