## **Research and Background**

Using *Publish or Perish*, we skimmed through a few research papers and understood that the existing method of measuring sleep is **Polysomnography (PSG)**, a difficult and intrusive test conducted in a specialist laboratory with several sensors and cables. Thus, each patient must remain in the same posture for one night, limiting their movements and disrupting sleep habits.

There has been considerable research and development in this area as it presents an **IoT-based sleep monitoring method** that is simple, inexpensive, and portable. It can also be used to remotely monitor the health status of the patient. Through our project, we aim to simplify the problem, focusing on a wearable that checks **REM (Rapid Eye Movement)** during sleep through indirect means of heartbeat monitoring. This should enable our device to be a simple, daily life wearable that will detect any abnormalities. We are also planning to have a respiratory sensor as a backup.
