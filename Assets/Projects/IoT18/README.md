| *Component*               | *Function*                                               | *Reason for Inclusion*                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Raspberry Pi 4*           | Acts as the central processing unit, handling sensor data and communication. | Provides computational power for processing sensor data, managing communication modules, and sending alerts to users. |
|                              |                                                           | Supports USB boot and network boot, eliminating the need for an SD card.               |
| *PIR Sensor (HC-SR501)*    | Detects motion by sensing infrared radiation changes from humans or animals. | Essential for motion detection; adjustable, reliable, and affordable.                  |
| *Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)* | Measures distance to detect objects or intrusions beyond the PIR range.  | Enhances detection accuracy, reducing false positives.                                 |
| *Smartphone (Phone Camera)*| Captures images or videos for visual confirmation of intrusions. | Acts as a cost-effective alternative to IP cameras; enables video surveillance.         |
|                              |                                                           | Connects via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to stream footage to the Raspberry Pi or cloud.         |
| *Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266 or ESP32)* | Provides wireless communication between the Raspberry Pi and cloud or mobile devices. | Enables IoT functionality for sending alerts and notifications over a network.         |
| *Buzzer or Alarm*          | Produces an audible alert when an intrusion is detected.  | Provides immediate local notification for nearby individuals.                          |
| *LED Indicators*           | Provides visual feedback for system status (e.g., active, idle, triggered). | Helps monitor the operational state of the system locally.                              |
| *Power Supply (5V Adapter)*| Powers the Raspberry Pi, sensors, and communication modules. | Ensures stable operation of all components.                                            |
| *USB Drive (or SSD)*       | Storage medium for booting the Raspberry Pi and temporary data storage. | Used for booting the OS and storing temporary files. Can replace SD cards.             |
| *Breadboard*               | Facilitates prototyping and wiring of components.         | Allows modular connections without soldering.                                          |
| *Jumper Wires*             | Connects components to the Raspberry Pi or breadboard.    | Essential for creating circuit setups.                                                 |
| *Resistors (e.g., 330Î©)*   | Protects LEDs and other components by limiting current flow. | Prevents damage to sensitive components from overcurrent.                               |
