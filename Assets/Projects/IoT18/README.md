## Problem Statement
Current smart home solutions often lack integration, requiring multiple systems for security, health monitoring, and dietary management. This project aims to develop a unified IoT-based platform that ensures home security through intrusion detection, monitors health via sensors, and provides personalized dietary recommendations, enhancing convenience, safety, and well-being in a smart living environment.

## Literature Survey
### Existing Solutions
1. **Smart Home Security Systems:** 
   - Systems like Ring and SimpliSafe focus primarily on home security, offering motion sensors, cameras, and alarm systems. However, these lack health and dietary integration.
2. **Health Monitoring Devices:**
   - Devices like Fitbit and smartwatches monitor vital signs but are standalone systems not integrated with home automation.
3. **Dietary Recommendation Apps:**
   - Mobile applications like MyFitnessPal provide meal recommendations but rely on manual input and are not integrated with health monitoring devices.
### Research Gaps & Our Objective
1. **Lack of Integration:** Existing systems focus on either security, health, or diet but fail to combine them into a unified platform.
2. **Real-Time Insights:** Most systems lack real-time data analysis and response capabilities.
3. **Accessibility:** Standalone systems can be complex and require multiple devices or apps.

**Objective:** To develop an integrated IoT-based smart home system that ensures security, monitors health, and provides dietary assistance in real-time, catering to both convenience and well-being.

### Challenges
1. **Hardware Integration:** Ensuring seamless communication between multiple sensors and devices.
2. **Data Processing:** Managing and analyzing real-time data efficiently.
3. **User Privacy:** Safeguarding sensitive health and security data.
4. **Reliability:** Ensuring the system performs accurately under different conditions.
