# IoT-Based Battery Monitoring System for Electric Vehicles

## Problem Statement
The growing reliance on battery-powered devices, particularly in IoT-based applications, has raised concerns about battery health, performance, and efficient management. Traditional battery monitoring systems lack real-time tracking, remote access, and automated management features. This leads to issues such as overcharging, undercharging, and inefficient energy consumption, reducing the lifespan and reliability of batteries.

The proposed IoT-Based Battery Surveillance and Management System aims to address these challenges by providing:
- Real-time monitoring of battery health.
- Remote management via a web or mobile interface.
- Enhanced performance and longevity of IoT device power sources.
