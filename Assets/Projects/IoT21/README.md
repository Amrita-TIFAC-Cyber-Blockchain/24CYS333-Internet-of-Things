## IoT#21 - IoT-Based Automated Fertilizer Dispensing System for Real-Time Nutrient Optimization in Agriculture

### Problem Statement:<br>
Agriculture faces challenges in achieving efficient crop growth while minimizing environmental harm due to inefficient fertilizer application methods. Overuse or underuse of nutrients harms soil health, reduces yields, and increases costs, while excessive runoff leads to water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The absence of precise, real-time monitoring and automated solutions exacerbates nutrient imbalances, failing to account for diverse soil conditions and crop requirements. An IoT-Based Automated Fertilizer Dispensing System can address these issues by leveraging smart sensors to monitor soil conditions and automate precise fertilizer delivery, optimizing resource use and promoting sustainable farming practices.

### Literature Survey:<br>
#### Existing Solutions:
Existing solutions in IoT-enabled smart farming focus on precision agriculture and resource optimization.

- Smart Fertilizer Systems: Use soil nutrient sensors and automated dispensers to optimize fertilizer usage, triggered by soil moisture and nutrient levels to minimize wastage.<br>
- Cloud-Connected Platforms: IoT tools like ThingSpeak and AWS IoT enable remote monitoring of soil health and fertilizer use via dashboards.<br>
- AI Integration: Predictive models analyze historical data to anticipate crop needs and optimize nutrients proactively.<br>
- Wireless Communication: Protocols such as MQTT and LoRaWAN facilitate real-time data transmission for efficient farming.<be>

#### Challenges Identified:<br>
1. Sensor Calibration: Ensuring sensor accuracy and reliability under varying environmental conditions.<br>
2. Interoperability: Integrating hardware and software components seamlessly.<br>
3. Data Latency: Ensuring real-time responsiveness for dispensing mechanisms.<br>
4. Energy Management: Balancing power consumption for extended deployments.<br>



### Hardware Requirements:<br>
- NPK Soil Sensor <br>
- Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2 <br>
- Solenoid Valve <br>
- Water Pump <br>
- Sprayer System <br>
- Raspberry Pi <br>
- GSM module (SIM800) <br>
- Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266/ESP32) <br>
- Battery <br>
- Breadboard <br>

### Sustainable Development Goals:

1. SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
The system reduces waste and promotes efficient use of fertilizers, supporting sustainable consumption and production patterns.
2. SDG 13: Climate Action
By minimizing greenhouse gas emissions from excessive fertilizer use and runoff, the system contributes to climate change mitigation efforts.
