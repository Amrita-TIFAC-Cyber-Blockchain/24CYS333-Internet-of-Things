## IoT#07 Real-Time IoT-Driven Public Transport Scheduling and Tracking System

**Problem Statement:** The project proposes a Real-Time IoT-Driven Public Transport Scheduling and Tracking System to address challenges like traffic congestion, route changes, and delays. Utilizing IoT technology, GPS sensors, and wireless communication, vehicles are monitored in real-time, providing data on location, speed, and routes to a central system. Passengers can access real-time updates on arrival times, delays, and occupancy through mobile apps or digital boards at bus stops, enabling efficient passenger flow management and reduced waiting times.

**SDG**
- Sustainable Cities and Communities, specifically targeting improved access to efficient, safe, and sustainable public transport systems while reducing environmental impact and enhancing urban mobility.

**Literature Survey**
- IoT technology is transforming public transport by enabling real-time tracking, scheduling, and passenger updates. Studies highlight the use of GPS and wireless communication for vehicle monitoring and predictive analytics for traffic management. Passenger information systems improve satisfaction through real-time updates, while IoT sensors manage occupancy effectively. Research also emphasizes environmental benefits through optimized routes, though challenges like cost, scalability, and security need to be addressed. These systems align with sustainability goals, promoting efficient and eco-friendly transport.
