## Title: Real-Time IoT-Driven Public Transport Scheduling and Tracking System

**Problem Statement:** The project proposes a Real-Time IoT-Driven Public Transport Scheduling and Tracking System to address challenges like traffic congestion, route changes, and delays. Utilizing IoT technology, GPS sensors, and wireless communication, vehicles are monitored in real-time, providing data on location, speed, and routes to a central system. Passengers can access real-time updates on arrival times, delays, and occupancy through mobile apps or digital boards at bus stops, enabling efficient passenger flow management and reduced waiting times.

**Hardware Requirements:** <br>
- Neo 6m (GPS module) <br>
- ESP 32 Micro controller <br>
- GSM/GPRS Module (sim 800) <br>
- RFID Reader and Tags <br>
- Ultrasonic Sensor <br>
- OLED/LED Display Panel <br>
- Power Supply (Battery) <br>
- Temperature and Humidity Sensor <br>
- Accelerometer <br>
- Breadboard <br>
