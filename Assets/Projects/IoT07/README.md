## Title: Real-Time IoT-Driven Public Transport Scheduling and Tracking System

**Problem Statement:** The project proposes a Real-Time IoT-Driven Public Transport Scheduling and Tracking System to address challenges like traffic congestion, route changes, and delays. Utilizing IoT technology, GPS sensors, and wireless communication, vehicles are monitored in real-time, providing data on location, speed, and routes to a central system. Passengers can access real-time updates on arrival times, delays, and occupancy through mobile apps or digital boards at bus stops, enabling efficient passenger flow management and reduced waiting times.

**Hardware Requirements:** 
-Neo 6m(GPS module)
-ESP 32 Micro controller
-GSM/GPRS Module(sim 800)
-RFID Reader and Tags
-Ultrasonic Sensor
-OLED/LED Display Panel
-Power Supply (Battery)
-Temperature and Humidity Sensor
-Accelerometer
-Breadboard
