## <u>**Problem Statement**</u>
In regions with limited technological infrastructure, passenger safety, particularly for women during taxi rides, remains a pressing challenge. Existing solutions, while helpful, fail to provide comprehensive protection due to their high costs and lack of direct integration with authorities or offices for rapid intervention. These limitations leave passengers vulnerable in critical situations, highlighting the urgent need for an accessible, affordable, and robust safety system that can bridge these gaps effectively.


## <u>**Proposed Solution**</u>
The proposed solution is a standalone safety device designed to enhance the security of passengers, particularly women, during taxi rides. Upon identifying a route deviation or emergency, the device triggers smart alerts, notifying designated contacts and offices for rapid response. Additionally, the system logs travel history, enabling future analysis and insights.
