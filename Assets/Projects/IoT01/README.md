###Problem Statement:### 
Emergency ambulance services often face delays due to traffic congestion and 
inefficient communication between ambulances, traffic management systems, and 
hospitals. These delays can critically impact patient outcomes. The goal of this 
project is to design a Smart Ambulance System leveraging IoT technology to optimize 
ambulance routing with real-time traffic updates, facilitate seamless communication 
with hospitals for patient data and arrival notifications, and dynamically prioritize 
ambulances at traffic signals. The system aims to improve response times and 
enhance the overall efficiency of emergency medical services while ensuring data 
security and scalability.
