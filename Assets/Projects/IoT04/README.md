## Problem Statement : 
Volunteer-driven NGO campaigns face challenges in transparency, real-time participation tracking, and accurate data collection, especially in remote areas. The absence of IoT integration and reliance on manual methods lead to inefficiencies and scalability issues. IoT can enable real-time data collection, secure participation logging  to address these issues effectively.

### Literature Survey  

#### Existing Solutions  
Current systems addressing transparency, traceability, and incentivization in volunteer and supply-chain management include:  
- **Blockchain-Based Systems:** Implemented for traceability and data integrity in healthcare supply chains. Examples include MediLedger and Hyperledger Fabric, but these systems are predominantly transaction-centric and lack volunteer-driven campaign models.  
- **IoT-Enhanced Models:** Utilized for environmental tracking in supply chains, yet limited in decentralized real-time updates and scaling to low-resource volunteer networks.  
- **NFT-Enabled Traceability:** NFTs are employed for uniquely identifying assets, as seen in pharmaceutical supply chains, but their potential for volunteer recognition and rewards remains unexplored.  

#### Research Gaps  
1. **Community-Centric Rewards:** Limited focus on recognition-based rewards like NFTs for incentivizing volunteerism.  
2. **Unified Ecosystem:** Absence of an integrated platform connecting volunteers, NGOs, and SHGs to streamline efforts and amplify grassroots impacts.  
3. **Real-Time Data Logging:** Existing models inadequately incorporate IoT for transparent and immediate activity tracking, critical for decision-making in remote areas.  

#### Relevance of Proposed Work  
1. **Encouraging Volunteer Engagement:** By integrating NFT rewards, the project provides recognition that extends beyond monetary incentives, motivating sustained volunteer participation.  
2. **Empowering Grassroots Communities:** The redemption of blockchain-secured tokens for SHG products supports local economies and builds a direct connection between stakeholders.  
3. **Enhancing Transparency and Trust:** Blockchain ensures immutable logs of volunteer efforts and NGO resource use, fostering trust among participants.  
4. **Real-Time Activity Monitoring:** IoT integration enables real-time tracking of volunteer activities, increasing efficiency in campaign management.
