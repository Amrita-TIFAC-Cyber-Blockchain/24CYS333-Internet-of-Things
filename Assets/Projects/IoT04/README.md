### Problem Statement
Volunteer-driven NGO campaigns face challenges in transparency, real-time participation tracking, and accurate data collection, especially in remote areas. The absence of IoT integration and reliance on manual methods lead to inefficiencies and scalability issues. IoT can enable real-time data collection, secure participation logging  to address these issues effectively.

### Hardware Requirements

| Components               | Purpose                                                                                          |
|:-------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Raspberry Pi 4 Model B   | Serves as the central processing unit for managing IoT devices, processing data, and blockchain integration. |
| ESP32 Board              | Acts as a microcontroller for IoT operations, enabling connectivity and real-time data collection. |
| GSM Module (SIM800L)     | Facilitates communication and data transfer in areas with limited Wi-Fi access. |
| DHT11/DHT22              | Monitors temperature and humidity, providing real-time environmental data. |
| GPS Module (NEO-6M)      | Tracks the geographical location for geo-tagging data and monitoring field operations. |
| NFC Stickers             | Used for volunteer identification and logging participation securely. |
| RFID Tags                | Provides authentication and tracking for volunteers and equipment. |

### Literature Survey  

#### Existing Solutions  
Current systems addressing transparency, traceability, and incentivization in volunteer and supply-chain management include:  
- **Blockchain-Based Systems:** Implemented for traceability and data integrity in healthcare supply chains. Examples include MediLedger and Hyperledger Fabric, but these systems are predominantly transaction-centric and lack volunteer-driven campaign models.  
- **IoT-Enhanced Models:** Utilized for environmental tracking in supply chains, yet limited in decentralized real-time updates and scaling to low-resource volunteer networks.  
- **NFT-Enabled Traceability:** NFTs are employed for uniquely identifying assets, as seen in pharmaceutical supply chains, but their potential for volunteer recognition and rewards remains unexplored.  

#### Research Gaps  
1. **Community-Centric Rewards:** Limited focus on recognition-based rewards like NFTs for incentivizing volunteerism.  
2. **Unified Ecosystem:** Absence of an integrated platform connecting volunteers, NGOs, and SHGs to streamline efforts and amplify grassroots impacts.  
3. **Real-Time Data Logging:** Existing models inadequately incorporate IoT for transparent and immediate activity tracking, critical for decision-making in remote areas.

### Proposed Solution 

#### Relevance of Proposed Work  
1. **Encouraging Volunteer Engagement:** By integrating NFT rewards, the project provides recognition that extends beyond monetary incentives, motivating sustained volunteer participation.  
2. **Empowering Grassroots Communities:** The redemption of blockchain-secured tokens for SHG products supports local economies and builds a direct connection between stakeholders.  
3. **Enhancing Transparency and Trust:** Blockchain ensures immutable logs of volunteer efforts and NGO resource use, fostering trust among participants.  
4. **Real-Time Activity Monitoring:** IoT integration enables real-time tracking of volunteer activities, increasing efficiency in campaign management.

#### Use Case
1. Household Drinking Water Safety Homeowners install the system in residential water
 storage tanks to monitor water quality before consumption. The system sends alerts
 via a mobile app if contamination levels rise, prompting users to filter or replace the
 water. Helps maintain safe and clean drinking water at the household level,
 especially in areas with inconsistent water quality.
2. Water Treatment Plant Monitoring Water purification plants use the system to
 continuously monitor pH, TDS, and turbidity levels. If parameters exceed safe limits,
 the system triggers alerts for immediate corrective action (e.g., adjusting filtration or
 chemical treatment). Ensures compliance with government water quality standards
 (e.g., WHO, BIS).
3. Public Water Supply System Monitoring Municipal corporations install the system in
 public water tanks to monitor real-time water quality. If contamination or parameter
 deviations (e.g., high turbidity) are detected, the system alerts authorities to take
 action before distribution. Prevents the supply of unsafe drinking water to
 households and communities.

### Deliverables
- Web/Mobile Dashboard: Allows users to monitor the status of drinking water in real time and analyze past readings.
- Smart Water Quality Monitoring Device: Analyzes water quality and provides real-time data to the dashboard.
