## Remote Monitoring and Control of Borewell Pumps using IoT

**Problem Statement:**

Borewell pumps are critical for providing water in agriculture, industrial, and domestic sectors especially in remote areas. However, monitoring and controlling these pumps manually is challenging, time-consuming and inefficient. Problems such as pump failures, energy wastage, water overuse and delayed detection of issues lead to increased costs, resource wastage and operational inefficiencies. Current systems lack real-time remote monitoring and automated control capabilities leaving users unable to respond quickly to malfunctions or optimize pump operations.

**Hardware requirements:**
1. Arduino Uno: Serves as the main microcontroller that processes inputs from sensors and sends control signals to the relay module for operating the pump.
2. Wi-Fi module ESP8266: It connects the Arduino to the internet, enabling remote communication between the system and the user.
3. Water level sensor(HC-SR04): Measures the water level in the borewell to prevent dry running and ensure efficient pump operation.
4. Pressure sensor(BMP180): Monitors water pressure to detect leaks or maintain optimal flow.
5. Flow meter sensor(YF-S201): Tracks water flow rate to measure usage and detect anomalies like overflows.
6. Relay module:  Acts as a switch to control the DC motor pump based on the microcontrollerâ€™s commands.
7. 12V DC Motor Pump: Pumps water from the borewell to the desired location
8. 5V DC Power supply: Provides the necessary electrical power to the entire system, including the Arduino, sensors, Wi-Fi module, and pump.

**Software requirements:**
1. Arduino IDE: Programs and uploads code to microcontrollers for integrating and controlling sensors.
2. AWS Cloud platform: Provides remote data storage, real-time monitoring, and control of borewell pumps through analytics and dashboards.

**Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs):**
- **SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**

  Ensures efficient water usage, reduces wastage, and promotes sustainable groundwater management.
  
- **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**

  Optimizes energy and water resource usage, minimizing waste and encouraging sustainable practices.
