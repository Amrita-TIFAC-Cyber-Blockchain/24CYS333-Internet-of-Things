## IoT#16

Hardware Requirements  
1. Arduino Board : Acts as the central microcontroller for data collection and transmission.  
2. Sensors :  
   - Temperature Sensor (e.g., LM35, DHT22): Monitors ambient temperature.  
   - Humidity Sensor (e.g., DHT22): Measures air moisture levels.  
   - Color Sensor (e.g., TCS3200): Detects variations in leaf color, which can indicate diseases.  
3. Wi-Fi Module (e.g., ESP8266 or ESP32): Enables data transmission to a server or cloud platform.  
4. Battery:  Rechargeable lithium-ion battery or any suitable power source to ensure uninterrupted operation.  



Software Requirements  
1. Arduino IDE : For programming the Arduino board and uploading the code.  
2. Hardware Programming : Written in Arduino C/C++ for controlling sensors and modules.  
3. Server Back-End :  
   - Python : For server-side logic and communication with hardware.  
   - MySQL Database : For storing sensor data and logs for analysis.
