Required Hardware for IoT-Based Crop Management

  1. IoT Sensors
    Sensors are the core of IoT systems, collecting real-time environmental and crop data. Common types include:
        Temperature Sensors: Measure ambient temperature for assessing crop health.
        Humidity Sensors: Monitor air moisture levels to detect optimal growing conditions.
        Soil Moisture Sensors: Measure soil water levels to optimize irrigation.
        Light Sensors: Track sunlight exposure critical for photosynthesis.
        pH Sensors: Measure soil acidity or alkalinity for nutrient management.
        Gas Sensors: Detect gases like CO₂ or NH₃ to identify plant stress or decay.
        Camera Sensors: Capture high-resolution images of crops for AI-based disease detection.

  2.  Microcontrollers or Microprocessors
    These devices process sensor data and transmit it to the cloud.
        Microcontrollers: ESP32, Arduino, STM32 (for lightweight tasks).
        Microprocessors: Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson Nano (for high-power tasks like image processing).

  3. Communication Modules
    Ensure reliable data transmission using:
        Wi-Fi: ESP8266, ESP32 (short-range).
        Bluetooth: HC-05/HC-06 (local device communication).
        Zigbee: XBee modules (low power, short-range).
        LoRa: Long-range, low-power communication for remote deployments.
        Cellular: SIM800/900, LTE modules for internet connectivity.
        Choice: Depends on deployment area and power availability.

  4.  Power Supply
    Ensure uninterrupted field operation:
        Solar Panels with battery storage (ideal for remote areas).
        Direct Power Source (suitable for accessible locations).

  5. Edge Devices
    These devices process data locally and run AI/ML models for decision-making:
        NVIDIA Jetson Nano or Google Coral TPU for image classification and disease detection.

  6. Cloud Connectivity
    Essential for remote data storage and analysis.
        Hardware should support platforms like AWS IoT, Google Cloud IoT, or Microsoft Azure IoT.

  7. Actuators (for Control Systems)
    Automate responses to detected issues, such as:
        Irrigation Systems: Water pumps, sprinklers.
        Fertilizer or Pesticide Dispensers.
        Fans or Heaters: For microclimate control.

  8. Enclosures and Mounting
        Rugged Enclosures: Protect hardware from rain, dust, and heat.
        Mounting Systems: Optimize sensor and camera positioning.
