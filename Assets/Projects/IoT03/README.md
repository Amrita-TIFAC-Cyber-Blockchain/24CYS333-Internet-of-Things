### Problem Statement
 Ensuring the safety and quality of water is critical for public health and environmental sustainability. Traditional water testing methods are slow and lack real-time insights, making it difficult to address contamination promptly.

 This project aims to develop an IoT-based solution for real-time monitoring and analysis of water quality in diverse contexts, including drinking water supplies, household water systems, public water tanks, and agricultural water sources.

 By leveraging advanced sensors, data analytics, and cloud connectivity, the system will track parameters such as pH, turbidity, and contaminant levels, providing instant alerts on water quality issues. This enables proactive interventions to ensure safety, improve resource management, and maintain compliance with health and environmental standards across variousÂ applications.

 ### Literature Survey
 Existing IoT-based water quality monitoring systems typically focus on basic parameters like pH and TDS, using microcontrollers such as Arduino or ESP32 for real-time data transmission and platforms like ThingSpeak for visualization. However, they lack advanced analytics, monitor limited parameters, face scalability and energy efficiency challenges, and often neglect IoT security. Our project addresses these gaps by integrating predictive analytics to provide early warnings for contamination, expanding monitoring to include microbial content, heavy metals, and agricultural contaminants like nitrates and phosphates. Additionally, we aim to design scalable, energy-efficient solutions, such as solar-powered systems, suitable for diverse applications like drinking water, household systems, public water tanks, and agriculture. Robust IoT security measures will also ensure secure data transmission.

 ### Hardwares Required
1. Gravity: Analog pH Sensor/Meter Kit V2.
2. Gravity: Analog Turbidity Sensor for Arduino.
3. Gravity: Analog TDS Sensor/Meter for Arduino. 
4. DS18B20 Waterproof Temperature Sensor.
5. Microprocessor with Built-in Wi-Fi (ESP32).
6. Chlorine Sensor.
7. Ammonia Sensor.
8. Nitrate and Nitrite Sensor.

 ### Proposed Solution
- The proposed system utilizes IoT-enabled sensors to continuously monitor pH levels
and contaminant concentrations in real time.
- The collected data is transmitted to a cloud platform for analysis, where AI-driven
algorithms identify anomalies and provide actionable insights.
- Users receive instant alerts via a mobile app or dashboard, allowing for timely
interventions. This solution ensures efficient water quality management, promotes
public health safety, and meets regulatory compliance.

 ### Sustainable Development Goals
- SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation 
  - Ensuring access to safe and clean drinking water is a core aspect 
of this goal. Real-time monitoring and analysis of water quality 
directly contribute to achieving targets related to improving 
water safety and reducing contamination. 
- SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being 
  - Safe drinking water is essential for preventing waterborne 
diseases, thus promoting good health and reducing mortality 
rates. This IoT-based solution supports public health initiatives 
by minimizing risks associated with unsafe water.
