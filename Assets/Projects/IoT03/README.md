### Problem Statement
 Ensuring the safety and quality of drinking water is critical for public health, yet
 traditional water testing methods are often slow and lack real-time insights.
 This project focuses on an IoT-based solution for real-time monitoring and analysis
 of pH levels and contaminant concentrations in drinking water.
 By leveraging sensors, data analytics, and cloud connectivity, the system provides
 instant alerts on water quality issues, enabling proactive measures to ensure safety
 and compliance with health standards.

 ### Hardwares Required
1. Gravity: Analog pH Sensor/Meter Kit V2.
2. Gravity: Analog Turbidity Sensor for Arduino.
3. Gravity: Analog TDS Sensor/Meter for Arduino. 
4. DS18B20 Waterproof Temperature Sensor.
5. Microprocessor with Built-in Wi-Fi (ESP32).

 ### Solution
- The proposed system utilizes IoT-enabled sensors to continuously monitor pH levels
and contaminant concentrations in real time.
- The collected data is transmitted to a cloud platform for analysis, where AI-driven
algorithms identify anomalies and provide actionable insights.
- Users receive instant alerts via a mobile app or dashboard, allowing for timely
interventions. This solution ensures efficient water quality management, promotes
public health safety, and meets regulatory compliance.

 ### Sustainable Development Goals
- SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation 
  - Ensuring access to safe and clean drinking water is a core aspect 
of this goal. Real-time monitoring and analysis of water quality 
directly contribute to achieving targets related to improving 
water safety and reducing contamination. 
- SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being 
  - Safe drinking water is essential for preventing waterborne 
diseases, thus promoting good health and reducing mortality 
rates. This IoT-based solution supports public health initiatives 
by minimizing risks associated with unsafe water.
