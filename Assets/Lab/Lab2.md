### Exercise #1
#### Traffic Light Simulation
- **Objective:** Simulate a basic traffic light system with three LEDs (Red, Yellow, and Green).
  - Connect three LEDs (red, yellow, and green) to different pins of the Arduino with resistors.
  - Write a program to simulate a traffic light sequence:
    - Red ON for 5 seconds.
    - Yellow ON for 2 seconds.
    - Green ON for 5 seconds.
    - Loop the sequence.
   
### Exercise #2
#### Temperature Monitoring System
- **Objective:** Use a temperature sensor to display temperature readings on a serial monitor and trigger an LED if the temperature exceeds a threshold.
  - Connect a temperature sensor to the Arduino board.
  - Read the temperature data from the sensor and display it on the Serial Monitor.
  - If the temperature exceeds 30°C, turn on a red LED; otherwise, keep it off.
  - Modify the program to include a buzzer that beeps when the temperature exceeds 40°C.
