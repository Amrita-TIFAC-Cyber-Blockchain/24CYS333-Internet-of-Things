### Instructions for Students

#### 1. Fine-Tune Project Topic
- Review and refine your selected project topic based on team discussions and preliminary research.
- Ensure the topic is specific, relevant, and addresses a real-world IoT problem.

#### 2. Hardware Resource Mapping
- Identify all hardware components required for the project (e.g., sensors, microcontrollers, communication modules, power supplies).
- Create a detailed list specifying each component, its function, and why it is necessary for the project.

#### 3. Literature Survey
- Use the **"Publish or Perish"** tool to search for academic papers related to your project.
- Focus on key areas: enabling technologies, protocols, previous implementations, and challenges.
- Summarize findings in a report:
  - **Existing Solutions:** What’s already done in this space?
  - **Research Gaps:** What’s missing or can be improved?
  - **Relevance:** Why is your project significant?
