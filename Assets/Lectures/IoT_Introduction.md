## Introduction to IoT

### Definition
As discussed, understanding the definition of any technology is very important, in this case, Internet of Things (IoT). Below are some of the definitions: <br/>
  <div class="description">
        <p class="source"><b>Oracle:</b></p>
        <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        <p class="source"><b>IBM:</b></p>
        <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other physical objects that are embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity, allowing them to collect and share data.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        <p class="source"><b>AWS Amazon:</b></p>
        <p>The term IoT, or Internet of Things, refers to the collective network of connected devices and the technology that facilitates communication between devices and the cloud, as well as between the devices themselves. Thanks to the advent of inexpensive computer chips and high bandwidth telecommunication, we now have billions of devices connected to the internet. This means everyday devices like toothbrushes, vacuums, cars, and machines can use sensors to collect data and respond intelligently to users.</p>
    </div>
 
Though, there are common understanding and key terms in each of the definitions provided above (and more you might find on the internet), we still required a common and strong definition for IoT. 

### Reasons -  Need for a common definition of IoT:
Two main reasons as stated in a Research article: <br/>
<p>- It can be assumed that growth in both the volume of literature and diversification of the subject areas has led to vagueness and more variety as to what constitutes the IoT. Having a common definition will help us weave together the core concepts and technologies that should be seen as fundamental to the IoT.</p>
<p>- Several synonyms or terms describing a similar concept have emerged during the past years. Without a commonly agreed definition, it is challenging to position emerging research and application areas such as Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPS), Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Industry 4.0 or the Internet of Things and Services related to the IoT (IoT&S).</p>
